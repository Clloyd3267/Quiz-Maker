aks$1 Corinthians$9$19$$FTV$Though » I am free and ...$belong to no one I have made myself a slave to everyone to win as many as possible.
akt$1 Corinthians$9$20$$FTV$To the Jews » I became …$like a Jew to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law) so as to win those under the law.

ald$1 Corinthians$10$16$$FTV$Is not » the cup of ...$thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?

alh$1 Corinthians$11$1$$FTV$Follow my » example as I ...$follow the example of Christ.
ali$1 Corinthians$11$23$$FTV$For I received » from the …$Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus on the night he was betrayed took bread.

amd$1 Corinthians$13$13$$FTV$And now these » three remain: ...$faith hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
ame$1 Corinthians$14$1$$FTV$Follow the » way of love ...$and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit especially prophecy.

ane$2 Corinthians$5$5$$FTV$Now the one » who has …$fashioned us for this very purpose is God who has given us the Spirit as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come.
