ahd$1 Corinthians$11$27$$FTV$So then, whoever » eats the …$bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
ahe$1 Corinthians$12$11$$FTV$All these » are the work …$of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines.
ahf$1 Corinthians$12$12$$FTV$Just » as a body, though …$one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ.
ahg$1 Corinthians$12$26$$FTV$If one » part suffers, every …$part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
ahh$1 Corinthians$12$27$$FTV$Now you » are the body …$of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
ahi$1 Corinthians$13$4$$FTV$Love is » patient, love is …$kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
ahj$1 Corinthians$13$5$$FTV$It does » not dishonor others, …$it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
ahk$1 Corinthians$13$6$$FTV$Love does » not delight in …$evil but rejoices with the truth. 
ahl$1 Corinthians$13$7$$FTV$It always » protects, always trusts, ...$always hopes, always perseveres.
ahm$1 Corinthians$13$8$$FTV$Love never » fails. But where …$there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
ahn$1 Corinthians$14$1$$FTV$Follow the » way of love ...$and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy.
aho$1 Corinthians$14$22$$FTV$Tongues, » then, are a sign, …$not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers.
ahp$1 Corinthians$14$29$$FTV$Two » or three prophets should …$speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.
ahq$1 Corinthians$14$32$$FTV$The spirits » of prophets are …$subject to the control of prophets.
ahr$1 Corinthians$14$40$$FTV$But everything » should be done ...$in a fitting and orderly way.
ahs$1 Corinthians$15$10$$FTV$But by » the grace of ...$God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
aht$1 Corinthians$15$24$$FTV$Then the » end will come, …$when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power.
ahu$1 Corinthians$15$39$$FTV$Not all flesh » is the …$same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another.
ahv$1 Corinthians$16$13$$FTV$Be on » your guard; stand …$firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong.
ahw$1 Corinthians$16$23$$FTV$The grace » of the Lord ...$Jesus be with you.
ahx$2 Corinthians$1$3$$FTV$Praise » be to the God …$and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort.
ahy$2 Corinthians$1$23$$FTV$I call » God as my …$witness—and I stake my life on it—that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.
ahz$2 Corinthians$2$9$$FTV$Another » reason I wrote you …$was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.
aia$2 Corinthians$3$2$$FTV$You yourselves » are our letter…$written on our hearts, known and read by everyone.
aib$2 Corinthians$4$17$$FTV$For our » light and momentary ...$troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
aic$2 Corinthians$5$5$$FTV$Now the one » who has …$fashioned us for this very purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
aid$2 Corinthians$5$7$$FTV$For we live » by faith, ...$not by sight.
aie$2 Corinthians$5$10$$FTV$For we must » all appear…$before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.
aif$2 Corinthians$5$15$$FTV$And he » died for all…$that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.
aig$2 Corinthians$5$21$$FTV$God made » him who had ...$no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
aih$2 Corinthians$6$3$$FTV$We put » no stumbling block ...$in anyone’s path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.
aii$2 Corinthians$6$16$$FTV$What agreement » is there between …$the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God and they will be my people.
aij$2 Corinthians$7$10$$FTV$Godly » sorrow brings repentance that ...$leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.
aik$2 Corinthians$8$9$$FTV$For you know » the grace ...$of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.
ail$2 Corinthians$8$13$$FTV$Our » desire is not that ...$others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality.
aim$2 Corinthians$8$14$$FTV$At » the present time your ...$plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality.
ain$2 Corinthians$9$6$$FTV$Remember » this: Whoever sows sparingly …$will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
aio$2 Corinthians$9$7$$FTV$Each of » you should give ...$what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
aip$2 Corinthians$9$11$$FTV$You will » be enriched in …$every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
aiq$1 Corinthians$5$7$$FTV$Get » rid of the old yeast, …$so that you may be a new unleavened batch— as you really are.  For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
air$1 Corinthians$12$31$$FTV$Now eagerly » desire the greater ...$gifts.  And yet I will show you the most excellent way.
ais$1 Corinthians$1$1$$FTV$Paul, called » to be an …$apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes.
ait$1 Corinthians$1$18$$FTV$For the message » of the…$cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
aiu$1 Corinthians$1$21$$FTV$For since in » the wisdom…$of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.
aiv$1 Corinthians$1$25$$FTV$For the foolishness » of God …$is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.
aiw$1 Corinthians$1$27$$FTV$But God chose » the foolish …$things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.
aix$1 Corinthians$1$30$$FTV$It is because » of him …$that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God— that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.
aiy$1 Corinthians$1$5$$FTV$For in » him you have …$been enriched in every way—with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge.
aiz$1 Corinthians$10$21$$FTV$You cannot » drink the cup ...$of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons.
aja$1 Corinthians$10$24$$FTV$No one should » seek their …$own good, but the good of others.
ajb$1 Corinthians$10$6$$FTV$Now these » things occurred as …$examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did.
ajc$1 Corinthians$11$23$$FTV$For I received » from the …$Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread.
ajd$1 Corinthians$11$24$$FTV$And when he » had given …$thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.
aje$1 Corinthians$11$29$$FTV$For those » who eat and …$drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves.
ajf$1 Corinthians$11$32$$FTV$Nevertheless when >> we are judged$in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.
ajg$1 Corinthians$12$21$$FTV$The eye » cannot say to…$the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot say to the feet, “I don’t need you!”
ajh$1 Corinthians$12$7$$FTV$Now to each » one the …$manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.
aji$1 Corinthians$13$1$$FTV$If I speak » in the ...$tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
ajj$1 Corinthians$13$13$$FTV$And now these » three remain: ...$faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
ajk$1 Corinthians$13$2$$FTV$If I have » the gift ...$of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
ajl$1 Corinthians$15$22$$FTV$For as in » Adam all ...$die, so in Christ all will be made alive.
ajm$1 Corinthians$15$25$$FTV$For he must » reign until ...$he has put all his enemies under his feet.
ajn$1 Corinthians$16$2$$FTV$On the first » day of ...$every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made.
ajo$1 Corinthians$2$14$$FTV$The person without » the Spirit…$does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.
ajp$1 Corinthians$2$2$$FTV$For I resolved » to know …$nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
ajq$1 Corinthians$3$10$$FTV$By the grace » God has ...$given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it.  But each one should build with care.
ajr$1 Corinthians$3$10$$FTV$By the grace » God has …$given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care.
ajs$1 Corinthians$3$11$$FTV$For no one » can lay ...$any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.
ajt$1 Corinthians$3$19$$FTV$For the wisdom » of this  …$world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness”.
aju$1 Corinthians$3$2$$FTV$I gave » you milk, not ...$solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.
ajv$1 Corinthians$3$6$$FTV$I planted » the seed, Apollos …$watered it, but God has been making it grow.
ajw$1 Corinthians$4$20$$FTV$For the kingdom » of God  …$is not a matter of talk but of power.
ajx$2 Corinthians$1$5$$FTV$For just » as we share…$abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ.
ajy$2 Corinthians$10$4$$FTV$The weapons » we fight with ...$are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.
ajz$2 Corinthians$10$5$$FTV$We demolish » arguments and every ...$pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.
aka$2 Corinthians$12$9$$FTV$But he » said to me…$“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me.
akb$2 Corinthians$13$11$$FTV$Finally, » brothers and sisters, rejoice…$Strive for full restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.
akc$2 Corinthians$13$14$$FTV$May » the grace of the…$Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
akd$2 Corinthians$13$5$$FTV$Examine » yourselves to see whether…$you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?
ake$2 Corinthians$13$8$$FTV$For we cannot » do anything…$against the truth, but only for the truth.
akf$2 Corinthians$3$17$$FTV$Now the Lord » is the ...$Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
akg$2 Corinthians$3$6$$FTV$He has made » us competent ...$as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
akh$2 Corinthians$3$9$$FTV$If the ministry » that brought …$condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness.
aki$2 Corinthians$4$18$$FTV$So we fix » our eyes …$not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
akj$2 Corinthians$5$20$$FTV$We are therefore » Christ’s ambassadors, …$as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.
