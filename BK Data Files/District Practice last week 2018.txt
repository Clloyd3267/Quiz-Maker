$1 Corinthians$6$13$$FTV$"You say, » ""Food for the …"$stomach and the stomach for food, and God will destroy them both.” The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

$1 Corinthians$13$8$$FTV$Love never » fails. But where …$there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
$1 Corinthians$14$1$$FTV$Follow the » way of love ...$and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy.
$1 Corinthians$14$22$$FTV$Tongues, » then, are a sign, …$not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers.
$1 Corinthians$14$29$$FTV$Two » or three prophets should …$speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.
$1 Corinthians$14$32$$FTV$The spirits » of prophets are …$subject to the control of prophets.
$1 Corinthians$14$40$$FTV$But everything » should be done ...$in a fitting and orderly way.
$1 Corinthians$15$10$$FTV$But by » the grace of ...$God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
$1 Corinthians$15$24$$FTV$Then the » end will come, …$when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power.
$1 Corinthians$15$39$$FTV$Not all flesh » is the …$same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another.
$1 Corinthians$16$13$$FTV$Be on » your guard; stand …$firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong.
$1 Corinthians$16$23$$FTV$The grace » of the Lord ...$Jesus be with you.
$2 Corinthians$1$3$$FTV$Praise » be to the God …$and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort.
$2 Corinthians$1$23$$FTV$I call » God as my …$witness—and I stake my life on it—that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.
$2 Corinthians$2$9$$FTV$Another » reason I wrote you …$was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.
$2 Corinthians$3$2$$FTV$You yourselves » are our letter…$written on our hearts, known and read by everyone.
$2 Corinthians$4$17$$FTV$For our » light and momentary ...$troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
$2 Corinthians$5$5$$FTV$Now the one » who has …$fashioned us for this very purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
$2 Corinthians$5$7$$FTV$For we live » by faith, ...$not by sight.
$2 Corinthians$5$10$$FTV$For we must » all appear…$before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.
$2 Corinthians$5$15$$FTV$And he » died for all…$that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.
$2 Corinthians$5$21$$FTV$God made » him who had ...$no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
$2 Corinthians$6$3$$FTV$We put » no stumbling block ...$in anyone’s path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.
$2 Corinthians$6$16$$FTV$What agreement » is there between …$the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God and they will be my people.
$2 Corinthians$7$10$$FTV$Godly » sorrow brings repentance that ...$leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.
$2 Corinthians$8$9$$FTV$For you know » the grace ...$of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.
$2 Corinthians$8$13$$FTV$Our » desire is not that ...$others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality.
$2 Corinthians$8$14$$FTV$At » the present time your ...$plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality.
$2 Corinthians$9$6$$FTV$Remember » this: Whoever sows sparingly …$will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
$2 Corinthians$9$7$$FTV$Each of » you should give ...$what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
$2 Corinthians$9$11$$FTV$You will » be enriched in …$every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
$1 Corinthians$1$1$$FTV$Paul, called » to be an …$apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes.
$1 Corinthians$1$18$$FTV$For the message » of the…$cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
$1 Corinthians$1$21$$FTV$For since in » the wisdom…$of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.
$1 Corinthians$1$25$$FTV$For the foolishness » of God …$is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.
$1 Corinthians$1$27$$FTV$But God chose » the foolish …$things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.
$1 Corinthians$1$30$$FTV$It is because » of him …$that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God— that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.
$1 Corinthians$1$5$$FTV$For in » him you have …$been enriched in every way—with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge.
$1 Corinthians$10$21$$FTV$You cannot » drink the cup ...$of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons.
$1 Corinthians$10$24$$FTV$No one should » seek their …$own good, but the good of others.
$1 Corinthians$10$6$$FTV$Now these » things occurred as …$examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did.
$1 Corinthians$11$23$$FTV$For I received » from the …$Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread.
$1 Corinthians$11$24$$FTV$And when he » had given …$thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.
$1 Corinthians$11$29$$FTV$For those » who eat and …$drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves.
$1 Corinthians$11$32$$FTV$Nevertheless when >> we are judged$in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.
$1 Corinthians$12$21$$FTV$The eye » cannot say to…$the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot say to the feet, “I don’t need you!”
$1 Corinthians$12$7$$FTV$Now to each » one the …$manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.
$1 Corinthians$13$1$$FTV$If I speak » in the ...$tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
$1 Corinthians$13$13$$FTV$And now these » three remain: ...$faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
$1 Corinthians$13$2$$FTV$If I have » the gift ...$of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
$1 Corinthians$15$22$$FTV$For as in » Adam all ...$die, so in Christ all will be made alive.
$1 Corinthians$15$25$$FTV$For he must » reign until ...$he has put all his enemies under his feet.
$1 Corinthians$16$2$$FTV$On the first » day of ...$every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made.
$1 Corinthians$2$14$$FTV$The person without » the Spirit…$does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.
$1 Corinthians$2$2$$FTV$For I resolved » to know …$nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
$1 Corinthians$3$10$$FTV$By the grace » God has ...$given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it.  But each one should build with care.
$1 Corinthians$3$10$$FTV$By the grace » God has …$given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care.
$1 Corinthians$3$11$$FTV$For no one » can lay ...$any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.
$1 Corinthians$3$19$$FTV$For the wisdom » of this  …$world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness”.
$1 Corinthians$3$2$$FTV$I gave » you milk, not ...$solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.
$1 Corinthians$3$6$$FTV$I planted » the seed, Apollos …$watered it, but God has been making it grow.
$1 Corinthians$4$20$$FTV$For the kingdom » of God  …$is not a matter of talk but of power.
$2 Corinthians$1$5$$FTV$For just » as we share…$abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ.
$2 Corinthians$10$4$$FTV$The weapons » we fight with ...$are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.
$2 Corinthians$10$5$$FTV$We demolish » arguments and every ...$pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.
$2 Corinthians$12$9$$FTV$But he » said to me…$“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me.
$2 Corinthians$13$11$$FTV$Finally, » brothers and sisters, rejoice…$Strive for full restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.
$2 Corinthians$13$14$$FTV$May » the grace of the…$Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
$2 Corinthians$13$5$$FTV$Examine » yourselves to see whether…$you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?
$2 Corinthians$13$8$$FTV$For we cannot » do anything…$against the truth, but only for the truth.
$2 Corinthians$3$17$$FTV$Now the Lord » is the ...$Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
$2 Corinthians$3$6$$FTV$He has made » us competent ...$as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
$2 Corinthians$3$9$$FTV$If the ministry » that brought …$condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness.
$2 Corinthians$4$18$$FTV$So we fix » our eyes …$not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
$2 Corinthians$5$20$$FTV$We are therefore » Christ’s ambassadors, …$as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.
$1 Corinthians$1$4$$INT$I always » thank my God for you why?$Because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.

$1 Corinthians$14$5$$FTV$I would like every » one …$of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified.
$1 Corinthians$16$22$$FTV$If anyone does » not love …$the Lord, let that person be cursed! Come, Lord.
$1 Corinthians$2$1$$FTV$And so » it was with …$me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.
$1 Corinthians$3$16$$FTV$Don’t you know that you » …$yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst.
$1 Corinthians$3$17$$FTV$If anyone destroys » God’s temple …$God will destroy that person; for God’s temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.
$1 Corinthians$4$15$$FTV$Even if you » had ten …$thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.
$1 Corinthians$5$2$$FTV$And you are proud! » Shouldn’t …$you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this.
$1 Corinthians$5$5$$FTV$Hand » this man over to …$Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.
$1 Corinthians$5$8$$FTV$Therefore let » us keep the…$Festival, not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
$1 Corinthians$7$17$$FTV$Nevertheless, each » person should live …$as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to them, just as God has called them. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches.
$1 Corinthians$7$2$$FTV$But since sexual » immorality is …$occurring, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband.
$1 Corinthians$7$29$$FTV$What I mean, brothers » and …$sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not.
$1 Corinthians$7$35$$FTV$I am saying » this for ...$your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.
$1 Corinthians$7$8$$FTV$Now to the » unmarried and …$the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do.
$1 Corinthians$8$1$$FTV$Now about food » sacrificed to ...$idols: We know that “We all possess knowledge.” But knowledge puffs up while love builds up.
$1 Corinthians$8$13$$FTV$Therefore, if what » I eat causes ...$my brother or sister to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall.
$1 Corinthians$8$4$$FTV$So then, about » eating food …$"sacrificed to idols: We know that “An idol is nothing at all in the world” and that “There is no God but one."""
$1 Corinthians$9$14$$FTV$In the same way, the… »$Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel.
$1 Corinthians$9$17$$FTV$If I preach » voluntarily, I …$have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me.
$1 Corinthians$9$26$$FTV$Therefore I do » not run …$like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air.
$2 Corinthians$1$21$$FTV$Now it is God » who …$makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us.
$2 Corinthians$11$27$$FTV$I have labored » and toiled …$and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked.
$2 Corinthians$11$3$$FTV$But I am afraid » that …$just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
$2 Corinthians$12$12$$FTV$I persevered » in demonstrating among …$you the marks of a true apostle, including signs, wonders and miracles.
$2 Corinthians$12$15$$FTV$So I will » very gladly …$spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less.
$2 Corinthians$12$19$$FTV$Have » you been thinking all …$along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening.
$2 Corinthians$12$20$$FTV$For I am afraid » that…$when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder.
$2 Corinthians$13$1$$FTV$This will » be my third …$visit to you. “Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
$2 Corinthians$2$4$$FTV$For I wrote » you out …$of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.
$2 Corinthians$4$16$$FTV$Therefore we do » not lose…$heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
$2 Corinthians$5$17$$FTV$Therefore, if anyone » is in…$Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!
$2 Corinthians$6$12$$FTV$We are not withholding » our …$affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us.
$2 Corinthians$6$14$$FTV$Do not be yoked » together …$with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?
$2 Corinthians$7$1$$FTV$Therefore, since we have these » …$promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.
$2 Corinthians$7$15$$FTV$And his affection » for you …$is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling.
$2 Corinthians$7$6$$FTV$But God, who » comforts the …$downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus.
$2 Corinthians$8$12$$FTV$For if the willingness » is ...$there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have.
$2 Corinthians$8$15$$FTV$"As it is written: ""The » …"$one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.
$2 Corinthians$8$24$$FTV$Therefore show » these men the ...$proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it.
$2 Corinthians$8$7$$FTV$But since you » excel in …$everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you—see that you also excel in this grace of giving.
